# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles which I use on all of my linux machines. Feel free to use it and modify it according to your needs.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run

```
$ dotfiles/install.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter a name and email for the git setup. To skip the git setup, add `nogit` as an argument to
the install script:

```
$ dotfiles/install.sh nogit
```
